👋 Hi, I’m Alireza

👀 I’m interested in front-end development, building full-stack applications using Next.js, and exploring new technologies in the JavaScript ecosystem.  

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced TypeScript and improving my skills in Tailwind CSS, while also expanding my knowledge of React libraries and tools. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web applications, open-source projects, or anything involving React, Next.js, and modern front-end frameworks.  

📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via email at alireza_sharifinasab@proton.me or on Telegram at https://t.me/ImAlirezaShn .  

⚡ Fun fact: I'm proficient in many React libraries and love creating fast, responsive, and scalable web apps using modern tools like Tailwind and TypeScript!
